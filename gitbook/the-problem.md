# 3. The Problem

DeFi has grown into a multi-billion ecosystem, but participation remains limited due to:

## 3.1 Educational & UX Barriers
- Steep learning curves  
- Complex risk frameworks  
- Confusing user interfaces  
- Limited access to credible education  

## 3.2 Liquidations & Rate Volatility
Mainstream money markets (Aave, Compound, etc.) rely on:
- Price-based liquidations  
- Variable interest rates  
- MEV/bot-driven execution  

Borrowers face:
- Unpredictable costs  
- Forced liquidations during volatility  
- Risk that is difficult to understand or model  

## 3.3 Chain Fragmentation
Users, assets, and liquidity are isolated across chains:

- Lenders are siloed  
- Borrowers are constrained  
- Credit histories cannot transfer across chains  
- Capital is inefficient and underutilized  

This fragmentation limits the reach of credit markets and reduces the efficiency of on-chain capital.
