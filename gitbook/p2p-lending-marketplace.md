# 7. The P2P Lending Marketplace

## 7.1 Design Principles
- Over-collateralized loans  
- Fixed-term, fixed-rate lending  
- No liquidations during the loan term  
- Lender-defined terms  
- Transparent borrower obligations  
- Progressive decentralization  

## 7.2 Loan Lifecycle
1. **Lender creates an offer**  
2. **Borrower matches offer**  
3. **Collateral is locked**  
4. **Loan runs to maturity**  
5. **Borrower repays or defaults**  
6. **Lender claims collateral if borrower defaults**  

## 7.3 Lender Benefits
- Predictable returns (subject to default risk)  
- Self-defined parameters  
- Priority placement for DFH stakers  

## 7.4 Borrower Benefits
- Unlock liquidity without selling assets  
- Predictable repayment terms  
- No liquidation due to intraday volatility  

## 7.5 Risk Management
- Conservative collateral listings (early stages)  
- Over-collateralized structure  
- Optional insurance layers (later phases)  
- Borrower reputation scoring
