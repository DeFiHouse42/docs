# DFH Token

The DFH token is intended to be the coordination asset of the DeFi House ecosystem. It is not yet launched. This section outlines the planned roles and mechanisms.

{% hint style="warning" %}
DFH does not exist as a live, tradable token at this time. All descriptions in this document are preliminary and may change.
{% endhint %}

## Purpose

The DFH token is designed to:

- Align incentives between participants and the protocol  
- Reward long-term engagement and responsible usage  
- Provide access to protocol benefits (fee discounts, priority, improved terms)  
- Eventually support governance and parameter decisions  

The token is not meant to be a simple speculative asset. Its design is tied to real protocol usage and risk mechanics.

## Planned Utility

The following are planned utilities of DFH in the lending protocol.

### Fee Discounts

Users who stake DFH will receive reduced protocol fees. This may apply to:

- Loan origination fees  
- Early repayment penalties  
- Listing or order placement fees  

Specific discount tiers (e.g. 30–50%) will depend on stake size and possibly lock-up duration.

### Priority Matching

Lenders who stake DFH may receive:

- Priority placement in the orderbook  
- Higher visibility to borrowers  
- Potential access to borrowers with stronger reputation  

This creates a clear link between staking and increased likelihood of offer matching.

### Improved Borrow Terms

Borrowers who stake DFH may receive:

- Eligibility for higher maximum collateral ratios (i.e. higher LTV within safe bounds)  
- Access to premium offers from lenders who restrict lending to DFH stakers or users with positive reputation  
- Reduced penalties or fees, where appropriate  

Any such enhancements will be carefully constrained to avoid compromising the protocol’s overall risk.

## Value Accrual Mechanisms (Planned)

The protocol will charge fees such as:

- Origination fees  
- Early repayment fees (if applicable)  
- Listing or maintenance fees  
- Potential future cross-chain settlement fees  
- Optional insurance premiums  

A significant share of these protocol fees is expected to flow back to DFH stakers through:

- Buyback and burn mechanisms, and/or  
- Direct distribution to staking pools  

The exact split and mechanisms will be defined before launch and may later be modified via governance.

Nothing in this section should be interpreted as a guarantee of yield, profit, or token price appreciation.  
Value accrual mechanisms describe how protocol fees may interact with DFH, not any expected outcome for holders.

## Staking

DFH staking is planned as a core mechanism to:

- Unlock utility (fee discounts, priority, improved terms)  
- Participate in value accrual mechanisms  
- Eventually qualify users for governance participation  

Staking will likely involve:

- A minimum staking period or unbonding delay  
- A proportional rewards model based on amount staked and duration  
- Risk-based components if staking is used to back insurance pools  

Details will be finalized closer to launch.

## Token Launch Plan (High-Level)

A high-level sequence for DFH token launch is:

1. Finalize token contract design  
2. Conduct internal testing and audits  
3. Define token distribution, including any private sale  
4. Deploy contracts and establish initial liquidity  
5. Activate staking and basic utility (such as fee discounts, once protocol usage is live)  

All steps are contingent on security review, market conditions, and legal considerations.
