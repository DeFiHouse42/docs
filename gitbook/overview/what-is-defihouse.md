# What is DeFi House

DeFi House is an education-driven ecosystem building toward a fixed-term, fixed-rate P2P lending protocol.  
The project integrates three components:

1. A growing educational and community foundation  
2. A lending protocol focused on predictability, clarity, and responsible collateralization  
3. The DFH token, which will coordinate incentives and later support governance  

The guiding idea is straightforward:  
**Enable users to understand decentralized finance, then provide them with tools that reflect that understanding.**
