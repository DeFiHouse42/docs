# 8. Cross-Chain Credit

## 8.1 The Fragmentation Problem
Today, lenders and borrowers are isolated by chain boundaries.  
This causes:
- Underutilized liquidity  
- Inconsistent rates across chains  
- Redundant infrastructure  
- Fragmented credit histories  

## 8.2 Cross-Chain Settlement Vision
In later phases, DeFi House aims to support:
- Lenders offering capital across multiple chains  
- Borrowers using collateral on one chain while borrowing on another  
- Synchronized loan states using secure messaging  
- Chain-agnostic reputation systems  

Benefits:
- A global pool of lenders  
- Better loan terms through deeper liquidity  
- More efficient capital deployment  
- Unified credit markets across ecosystems
