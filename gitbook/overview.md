# 🌱 What is DeFi House?

**DeFi House** is an education-first, community-driven initiative focused on empowering people to understand and participate responsibly in decentralized finance.

The project began as an effort to bring **real-world, accessible DeFi knowledge** to newcomers through in-person workshops. It has now grown into a broader vision:

- A **P2P lending protocol** offering fixed-term, fixed-rate, over-collateralized loans  
- A cross-chain credit network (future)  
- A responsible, transparent, community-oriented DeFi ecosystem  
- A token (DFH) aligned with the protocol’s long-term health  

DeFi House is headquartered in **Chicago**, where the in-person community has steadily grown.

# 🌍 Why DeFi House Exists

Traditional DeFi lending systems (Aave, Compound, etc.) rely heavily on:

- Oracle-based liquidations  
- Dynamic interest rates  
- Bot-driven execution  
- Fragmented, chain-local liquidity  

These create friction for everyday users who want predictable borrowing terms and simple risk management.

DeFi House believes **credit can be simple**:

✨ Fixed terms  
✨ Fixed rates  
✨ Transparent rules  
✨ Over-collateralized  
✨ No liquidations mid-term  

The lending protocol reflects this philosophy.
