# Overview

This document provides a high-level view of DeFi House: what it is today, what it aims to become, and how the different components fit together.

{% hint style="info" %}
DeFi House is currently in an early stage. The only live components today are:
- In-person workshops
- Weekly X (Twitter) Spaces
- Weekly Telegram community calls

The protocol, DFH token, and cross-chain functionality described here are planned and not yet deployed.

## What is DeFi House?

DeFi House is an education-first initiative that is building toward a credit-focused DeFi protocol.

At a high level, DeFi House consists of:

- An educational and community layer  
- A planned P2P lending protocol focused on fixed-term, fixed-rate, over-collateralized loans  
- A planned token (DFH) that coordinates incentives and, eventually, protocol governance  

The long-term vision is to create a responsible, understandable on-chain credit marketplace that is accessible to both new and experienced users.

---

## Mission

The mission of DeFi House is to make decentralized finance accessible, practical, and empowering by combining:

- Clear, high-quality education  
- Community-driven learning and support  
- Thoughtful protocol design that prioritizes predictability and risk awareness  

---

## Vision

The vision for DeFi House is a future where:

- Financial literacy is treated as a prerequisite, not a luxury  
- Users understand what they are doing on-chain, including risks  
- On-chain credit is transparent in terms of obligations, time horizons, and downside scenarios  
- Responsible, well-designed DeFi products are available to users across chains  

In this vision, DeFi House serves as both an educational hub and a protocol provider, with an emphasis on real-world usability and risk transparency.

## Core Principles

### Education before participation

DeFi House prioritizes education and context. Users should understand:

- How lending and borrowing work  
- What over-collateralization means in practice  
- What happens on default or non-repayment  
- How different types of collateral behave  

### Predictability over complexity

Instead of focusing on exotic mechanisms, the protocol will emphasize:

- Fixed-term, fixed-rate loans  
- Clear repayment schedules  
- Simple default logic  

### Responsible risk management

The design is oriented around:

- Over-collateralization  
- Conservative collateral types in early phases  
- Transparent handling of default scenarios  
- Incremental addition of complexity only when justified  

### Progressive rollout

The project is structured to:

- Start with education and community (already live)  
- Introduce the DFH token  
- Develop and launch a lending MVP on BNB Chain  
- Only later, expand to cross-chain and governance  

---

## Current Status

As of now, DeFi House consists of:

- Regular in-person workshops in Chicago  
- Weekly X (Twitter) Spaces  
- Weekly Telegram community calls  
- Early-stage documentation and protocol design work  

There is no deployed protocol, no live token, and no DAO governance at this stage.

Planned components (not yet live) include:

- DFH token launch  
- P2P lending protocol MVP on BNB Chain  
- Cross-chain lending and credit features  
- Governance mechanisms based on DFH staking and participation
