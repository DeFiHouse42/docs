# 4. Our Approach

DeFi House addresses these problems with a two-layer foundation:

## 4.1 Education & Community
Workshops, online sessions, and community calls form the **trust and literacy layer** that underpins responsible credit markets.

## 4.2 P2P Lending Layer
A protocol offering:
- Over-collateralized lending  
- Fixed-term, fixed-rate loans  
- No liquidations during loan term  
- Lender-defined interest rates, durations, and collateral ratios  
- A clear UX with predictable obligations  

Starting on BNB Chain and expanding to a **cross-chain credit network**, the system allows lenders and borrowers to interact across chains.
