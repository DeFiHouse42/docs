# Cross-Chain Vision

**Chain fragmentation** limits the effectiveness of *decentralized credit*.  
Lenders and borrowers are **separated by network boundaries**, reducing *matching opportunities*.

**DeFi House** aims to address this through a *phased approach*.

## Planned Cross-Chain Features
- **Cross-chain lender discovery**  
- *Collateral on one chain*, *borrowing on another*  
- **Unified borrower reputation** across networks  
- **Secure loan-state synchronization**  

{% hint style="warning" %}
Cross-chain functionality is a future phase that requires mature messaging infrastructure and extensive security review.
