# Problem Statement

*Decentralized lending* is dominated by **variable-rate, pool-based systems** that rely on:
- *Price-triggered liquidations*  
- *Oracle dependencies*  
- *Bot-driven execution*  
- *Fragmented liquidity* across chains  

These systems work well for certain use cases but introduce **challenges**:
- Borrowing outcomes are **difficult to predict**  
- Positions can be **liquidated** due to *temporary volatility*  
- Lenders have **limited ability** to tailor their risk exposure  
- Chain fragmentation prevents **efficient matching** of lenders and borrowers  

## How DeFi House Addresses This

### Fixed-term, fixed-rate lending
Borrowers know their **exact obligations in advance**.

### Over-collateralization with no mid-term liquidations
Collateral is **locked for the full loan term**.  
Risk is resolved **at maturity**, *not through price-action*.

### Lender-defined offers
Lenders select:
- **Duration**  
- **Required collateralization**  
- **Interest rate**  
- **Accepted collateral assets**  

### Focus on clarity and simplicity
*No leveraged looping*, *no variable-rate curves*, and *no complex liquidation engines*.

## Positioning Compared to Competitors

### PWN (P2P lending)
- Similar model (*offer-based P2P*)  
- DeFi House focuses on a **cleaner and more structured** fixed-term model  
- **Strong educational layer** to support adoption  
- Early emphasis on *cross-chain expansion*

### Morpho (hyper-efficient matching on top of Aave)
- Focuses on *optimizing rates* inside existing pools  
- DeFi House focuses on **direct P2P fixed-term credit**, *not pool optimization*  

### Traditional money markets (Aave, Compound)
- *Variable rates* and *liquidations*  
- DeFi House offers a **fixed, predictable alternative**  

**DeFi House fills a gap: predictable credit with transparent risk.**
