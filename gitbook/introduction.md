# 1. Introduction

DeFi House is an education-first, community-driven initiative focused on enabling individuals and teams to confidently learn, build, and transact in decentralized finance.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between **education** and **practical application**, transforming learners into active on-chain participants.

What began as a focused educational community is now evolving into a **P2P lending protocol** built around:

- Over-collateralized lending  
- Fixed-term, fixed-rate loans  
- No liquidations during the loan term  
- Lender-defined parameters  
- Cross-chain expansion to unify fragmented liquidity  

At the center of this ecosystem is the **DFH token**, designed to coordinate incentives, align users, and govern the protocol’s long-term evolution.
