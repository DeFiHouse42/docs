# 5. Community and Education

DeFi House began as an educational hub offering:

### 🏠 In-Person Workshops  
Hands-on learning about DeFi, liquidity, yield, smart contracts, and risk.

### 🎙 Weekly X (Twitter) Spaces  
Discussions with founders, experts, and ecosystem contributors.

### 🔊 Weekly Community Calls  
Roundtable discussions and guided support for builders and learners.

Education is the **foundation** of the DeFi House ecosystem.  
It produces participants who understand risk and act responsibly within the protocol.
