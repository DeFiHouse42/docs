# FAQ

This FAQ addresses common questions about DeFi House, the protocol, and the DFH token.

---

## Is the protocol live?

No. The lending protocol is not live yet. Only the educational and community activities are active.

---

## What currently exists?

- In-person workshops  
- Weekly X (Twitter) Spaces  
- Weekly community calls  
- Documentation and protocol design work  

---

## What is the next major milestone?

The next major milestone is the launch of the DFH token, followed by development and launch of the lending protocol MVP on BNB Chain.

---

## Why BNB Chain for the MVP?

BNB Chain is considered for the MVP because it offers:

- Relatively low transaction fees  
- A large base of retail users familiar with DeFi  
- A practical environment for testing protocol mechanics without mainnet Ethereum costs  

This choice can be revisited if conditions change.

---

## Will DFH accrue value from protocol usage?

The design anticipates that a share of protocol fees may be directed to DFH stakers via buybacks or distributions. However, this is not a guarantee of profit or appreciation. It is a mechanism, not an outcome.

---

## Is this a DAO?

No, not at this stage. Governance mechanisms will be implemented only after the protocol and token are launched and sufficiently tested.

---

## Will the protocol be audited?

Yes. Any production deployment of the lending protocol and token contracts is planned to be audited before launch.

---

## Where is DeFi House based?

DeFi House is anchored in Chicago for in-person events but aims to serve a global online community.
