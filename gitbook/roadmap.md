# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned phases of DeFi House. It is intended as a working plan rather than a fixed commitment.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (In Progress)

- Run regular in-person workshops  
- Maintain weekly X (Twitter) Spaces  
- Host weekly community calls  
- Build and refine educational materials  
- Design and document protocol architecture and token mechanics  

This phase is active and ongoing.

---

## Phase 2: DFH Token Launch (Planned Next)

- Finalize token contract design and parameters  
- Conduct security review and audit of the token contracts  
- Define token distribution, including private sale terms  
- Deploy DFH token and establish initial liquidity  

Only after the token launch will protocol development on mainnet move forward in full.

---

## Phase 3: Lending Protocol MVP on BNB Chain

- Implement core lending contracts  
- Implement collateral vaults and orderbook logic  
- Integrate DFH staking where necessary for protocol utility  
- Support a limited set of conservative assets as collateral and loan assets  
- Launch the MVP in a controlled or staged manner (for example, with caps)  

The MVP’s purpose is to validate the model with real users and limited scope, not to maximize TVL or growth.

---

## Phase 4: MVP Launch and Iteration

- Gather usage data and user feedback  
- Adjust parameters and features as needed  
- Expand supported assets cautiously  
- Improve tooling (analytics, interfaces, documentation)  

At this stage, the focus is on making the core lending product robust and understandable.

---

## Phase 5: Cross-Chain Expansion (Future)

- Explore secure cross-chain messaging solutions  
- Design cross-chain loan state synchronization  
- Expand the marketplace to additional chains (for example, Ethereum L2s)  
- Build a chain-agnostic borrower reputation framework  

This phase is inherently more complex and will only be undertaken after the single-chain version has proven stable.

---

## Phase 6: Governance Enablement (Future)

- Introduce governance processes tied to DFH staking  
- Allow token holders to influence protocol parameters and asset listings  
- Gradually transition key decisions from the core team to a broader governance process  

Governance is intentionally placed as a later milestone to avoid premature decentralization without sufficient user understanding and protocol maturity.
