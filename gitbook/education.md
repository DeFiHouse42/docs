# Education & Community

The educational and community layer is the foundation of DeFi House and is the only part of the ecosystem that is currently live.

---

## Purpose of the Education Layer

The education layer exists to:

- Reduce the knowledge barrier to participating in DeFi  
- Provide a safe environment to ask questions and explore ideas  
- Build a community that can contribute to the protocol in an informed way  
- Create a pipeline of users, contributors, and future governance participants  

The DeFi House team believes that many issues in DeFi adoption stem from a lack of context, fragmented information, and assumptions about user knowledge. The education layer is designed to address these issues directly.

## In-Person Workshops

DeFi House runs in-person workshops, primarily in Chicago. These sessions focus on:

- Fundamentals of blockchains, wallets, and transactions  
- How DeFi protocols (DEXes, lending, staking) actually work  
- Liquidity and yield concepts, including LP strategies and risks  
- Security basics: private keys, scams, contract risk  
- Practical walkthroughs of real on-chain flows  

Workshops are designed to be:

- Practical: using live examples and demonstrations  
- Transparent: explaining both benefits and risks  
- Interactive: emphasizing questions and discussion  

Workshops also serve as a way to test educational content that may later be turned into written guides, courses, or online resources.

## Community Calls

DeFi House hosts regular community calls, typically over Telegram voice.

Common themes include:

- Recaps of recent DeFi news and market movements  
- Open Q&A about DeFi concepts, protocols, and strategies  
- Discussion of protocol design decisions and potential trade-offs  
- Feedback on the evolving DeFi House roadmap  

These calls are informal but focused. They provide a channel for:

- Early user input  
- Identifying knowledge gaps  
- Building familiarity with DeFi concepts over time

## X (Twitter) Spaces

Weekly X (Twitter) Spaces are used to:

- Reach a wider audience beyond the local community  
- Invite guests from different parts of the ecosystem  
- Discuss topics such as:  
  - DeFi lending and credit markets  
  - Layer 2 and cross-chain infrastructure  
  - Token design and incentives  
  - Risk and governance  

These Spaces help position DeFi House as an education-oriented presence in the broader DeFi landscape, not just a protocol.

## Future Education Initiatives (Planned)

The following are planned but not yet implemented:

- Structured online modules, from introductory to advanced DeFi topics  
- Written guides and playbooks for using the future lending protocol  
- A structured contributor onboarding program  
- Risk and parameter frameworks for understanding lending markets  
- Workshops focused specifically on the DeFi House protocol once live  

These initiatives will be developed as the protocol itself moves closer to launch, to ensure educational content directly supports real use cases.
