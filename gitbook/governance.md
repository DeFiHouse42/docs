# 12. Governance

DeFi House governance is built on the belief that **education precedes influence**.

DFH token holders will govern:
- Protocol parameters  
- Asset listings  
- Risk settings  
- Treasury usage  
- Incentive programs  

Governance rolls out progressively:
1. Advisory and signaling  
2. On-chain parameter voting  
3. Full DAO-style governance (long-term)
