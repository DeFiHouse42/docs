# Governance (Planned)

Governance for DeFi House is a planned future component. It will be introduced only after the protocol has reached a level of maturity and stability.

## Guiding Principles

Planned governance is guided by several principles:

- Education first: protocol users and prospective voters should understand what they are voting on  
- Gradual decentralization: not all decisions need to be on-chain or token-driven immediately  
- Risk awareness: changes to key parameters (such as LTVs or collateral lists) should be made carefully and with clear reasoning  

---

## Governance Scope (Planned)

Over time, governance is expected to cover:

- Collateral listings and delistings  
- Collateralization ratios and other risk parameters  
- Fee structures and fee splits  
- Expansion to new chains  
- Treasury usage, if a treasury is maintained  

Initially, such decisions will be made by the core team. Governance will become more influential as the ecosystem matures.

## Governance Mechanisms (Planned)

Possible mechanisms include:

- Token-weighted voting with DFH staking  
- Safeguards such as quorum thresholds, delays, or vetoes  
- Off-chain signaling combined with on-chain execution  

The exact model will be chosen with emphasis on security, clarity, and practicality rather than novelty alone.
